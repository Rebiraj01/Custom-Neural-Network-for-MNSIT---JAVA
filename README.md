# Custom-Neural-Network-for-MNSIT---JAVA
While I was just getting into machine learning and AI, I wanted to truly understand how neural networks; work. So from scratch, using Java, I created a neural network that can classify digits from the MNIST dataset, the code is slow and unoptimized, but It helped me understand the concepts behind neural netowrks!
